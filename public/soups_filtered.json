    "Recipe_Name":"Summer Bean Soup With Tomato Brown Butter",
    "Ingredients":"['8 oz. (230 g) dried beans, such as flageolet or navy, or fresh shelling beans', '2 in. square dried kombu', '2 large tomatoes', '2 celery ribs', '1 carrot', '1 leek, white and light green parts only', '6 shallots, skins intact', '6 garlic cloves, minced', '4 oil-packed anchovy fillets', '6 Tbsp. (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil', '2 Tbsp. maple syrup', '1 \u00bd Tbsp. kosher salt', '1 Tbsp. red pepper flakes', '1 tsp. whole-grain mustard', '8 oz. (230 g) bacon', '8 oz. (230 g) Romano beans or green beans, chopped into 1 in. pieces', '2 shallots, thinly sliced', '1 tsp. red pepper flakes', 'Zest and juice of 1 lemon', '1 garlic clove, grated', '12 pickled green beans (see Basic Wet Salt Method, below)', '9 cherry tomatoes, quartered', '2 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '1 tsp. sherry vinegar', 'Tomato Brown Butter', 'Crumbled feta, parsley leaves, and marjoram leaves for garnish']",
    "Instructions":"Combine the dried beans and kombu in a large container and cover with plenty of water to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight; skip this step if using fresh beans.\nDrain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.\nRemove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.\nSet up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.\nIn a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Pur\u00e9e until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you\u2019re ready to serve.\nWhile the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Cut the bacon into \u00bc in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.\nIn a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.\nIncrease the heat slightly, and saut\u00e9 the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.\nThinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.\nTo serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it\u2019s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.\nThis works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you\u2019re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don\u2019t have an airlock, you\u2019ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely.",

    "Instructions":"Heat the stock in a large pot until it comes to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer. While it's heating, cut off the corn kernels from the cobs (cutting in a large salad bowl helps keep the kernels from flying all over). You should have about 4 1\/2 cups\/680 g of kernels. Place the 6 cobs in the stockpot, and simmer them covered, while you prepare the rest of the soup ingredients (for at least 20 minutes).\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut\u00e9 the onions for 3 minutes. Add the celery and thyme and saut\u00e9 for another 4 minutes. Turn off the heat.\nRemove the cobs from the stockpot with tongs, and place them on a plate to cool. Add the saut\u00e9ed vegetables, potatoes, 1 tsp salt, paprika, 1\/4 tsp pepper, cayenne, and coriander to the pot and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nMeanwhile, when the cooked cobs are cool enough to handle, take a sturdy knife and scrape down the sides of the cobs to collect the remainder of the kernels. This should yield about 1 cup\/150 g of kernel bits.\nAfter the soup has cooked for 25 minutes, stir in the soymilk, corn kernels, and corn kernel bits. Simmer for 3 minutes. Remove 1 qt\/960 ml of the soup and puree it in a blender or food processor until it's very smooth. Return the puree to the soup pot, and heat until it returns to a simmer, stirring frequently.\nWhile the soup simmers, hold the whole bell pepper with metal tongs over an open flame on the stovetop. Turn it frequently until the skin is charred all the way around, about 5 minutes. Remove it from the heat and let cool. Using a clean dishcloth, rub off the charred skin. Remove the stem and seeds and cut the flesh into a fine dice. Set aside.\nTurn off the heat for the soup and stir in the parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish each one with some of the red bell pepper. Serve immediately.",

    "Instructions":"1 Bring a large pasta pot two-thirds full of water to a boil, and using tongs, transfer 2 of the crabs to the pot. Cook until their shells turn bright orange, about 3 minutes, then transfer the cooked crabs to a colander set in the sink and run cold water over them. Add the next 2 crabs to the pot and repeat until all the crabs have been cooked.\n2 As each cooked crab becomes cool enough to handle, slip your thumb beneath the place on its underside where the cape of shell tapers to a point, and lift the bottom shell up, pulling the entire carapace off the body of the crab. Clean out and discard the spongy-feathery gills on the body. Carefully pick out any orange roe you may see inside the body, and reserve. Then snap one of the smaller legs off the body of the crab to use as a pick, to tease out any roe in the hollows of the carapace that taper to a sharp point, and reserve. Repeat with the remaining crabs until all the roe has been picked. Then split the crab bodies and legs, pick the meat from them, and add it to the rest of the picked crab meat.\n3 Pour off all but 3 cups of the cooking water, and add the picked crab bodies, legs, and carapaces, then return to a boil. Let boil until reduced by a third, about 10 minutes, and strain the crab broth into a 4-quart saucepan or Dutch oven.\n4 Heat the broth over high heat until it simmers. Put the flour in a small bowl or ramekin, spoon 3 tablespoons of the hot broth into it, and whisk it to a smooth paste with a fork. Pour the remaining broth into a blender, add 1\/4 cup of the crab roe, and liquefy until the roe is completely dissolved in the broth. With the blender running, add the flour paste to the broth.\n5 Return the Dutch oven to the heat and melt the butter over medium-low heat until it's frothy. Add the shallot, 1\/2 teaspoon salt, and 1\/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallot is soft, fragrant, and translucent, but not brown, about 4 minutes. Add the half-and-half, the broth mixture, and 1 tablespoon of the sherry, and cover. When the soup comes to a simmer, turn the heat to low, uncover, and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the soup has reduced by about one-sixth, 12 to 15 minutes.\n6 Add the crab meat and cook for 2 minutes over low heat, stirring to combine. Season the soup with salt and black pepper.\n7 Pour a teaspoon of sherry into each bowl before serving, and garnish each bowl with about 11\/2 teaspoons roe and chives, if using. Serve with additional sherry\u2014in a shot glass for each guest, or in a cruet for passing around the table\u2014for those who might want more.",

    "Instructions":"Char chiles over a gas flame or under a broiler, turning occasionally, until blackened all over (this adds a smoky flavor and makes the skins easy to remove). Let cool. Using a small knife, scrape skin from chiles; discard. Coarsely chop chiles (for a milder salsa, discard seeds).\nMake a paste by mincing garlic and 1 teaspoon salt on a work surface, scraping with the side of knife occasionally. Add chiles and finely chop, then add mint and finely chop. Transfer to a bowl; stir in oil. Season with more salt, if desired. DO AHEAD: Salsa can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Return to room temperature before using.\nPlace chicken and broth in a large heavy pot. Add water just to cover chicken. Bring to a simmer over high heat, skimming the surface occasionally (foam can add bitter flavors to soup; discard it as you skim). Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, continuing to skim surface occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add corn cobs, halved onion, garlic, carrot, celery, peppercorns, bay leaves, and 2 teaspoons salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer until breast meat is just cooked through, 15-20 minutes.\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board; let cool slightly. Cut off breast meat; set aside (cooking breast meat longer will make it tough). Return chicken to pot. Simmer over low heat until legs and thighs are cooked through, about 20 minutes longer.\nRemove pot from heat. Transfer chicken to a platter; let cool slightly. Strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve into another large pot; discard solids. Shred all chicken meat, discarding skin and bones.\nBring strained broth to a simmer.

    "Instructions":"Combine the hocks, vegetables, bay leaf, peppercorns, and 8 cups of water in a medium stockpot and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to low, put the lid on, and cook at a nice steady simmer until the meat on the hocks is so tender it's almost falling off the bone, 4 to 5 hours.\nCarefully remove the hocks and put them in a big bowl. Strain the cooking liquid through a sieve into the bowl, and discard the vegetables and aromatics. Let the hocks cool in the liquid.\nWhen the hocks are cool enough to handle, pull off the meat in bite-sized chunks. Discard the bones and any hard bits and some of the fat, but don't throw away the skin\u2014I add the skin to the soup in thin slices, along with the chunks of ham. You don't have to, but I like the way it goes sticky in the soup. You can keep the stock and meat (moistened with a splash of stock) in separate airtight containers in the fridge for up to two days. Gently warm the meat and skin before proceeding with the recipe. This recipe requires only 4 cups of stock\u2014you may freeze the leftover stock for up to a month for your next batch of soup.\nPut the butter in a large pot that has a lid and set it over medium heat. Once the butter starts to froth, add the onion, carrot, and salt and stir. Cover the pot and cook, stirring every now and again, until the onions are soft and creamy (but not colored) and the carrots are tender but firm, about 15 minutes.\nAdd the wine and bring it to a boil (turn the heat up if you need to). Let the wine boil until it's all but gone, about 5 minutes. Add the mint and 4 cups of the ham broth and bring the liquid to a boil, then add the peas. (At this point, the carrots will have bobbed to the top. I like to pick out most of the carrot chunks before pureeing the soup, then add them back after. That way, you can nibble on them in the soup, getting that bit of texture.) Cook at a simmer until the peas are warmed through and tender, about 5 minutes.\nBlend the pot's contents, in batches, until smooth. Return all the bright-green pea puree to the large pot, add the ham pieces and carrots, and cook at a very gentle simmer for about 5 minutes, just to let the flavors mingle and heat the ham. Have a taste, and season with salt. How much you need to add will depend on how salty the ham hocks are.\nAdd a generous drizzle of olive oil, several twists of black pepper, and the torn mint leaves. Then add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in little blobs here and there, so everyone will get a bit. Serve the soup in the pot, with small bowls along-side.",

    "Instructions":"Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Set aside\nPut the tomato paste and 7 quarts (6.6 kilograms) cold water in a large nonreactive stockpot over high heat. Whisk occasionally as the water comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle boil and cook for about 1 hour, or until it has reduced by about one-quarter. (Remove from the heat if the onions aren't ready.)\nMeanwhile, rinse the cilantro and parsley well and set aside. Cut the onions into large chunks. Put the chunks in a food processor and pulse until they are becoming a mush. Add as much of the herbs as fit into the food processor. Pulse the machine, adding small amounts of cold water if necessary to allow the blade to spin. As the herbs decrease in volume, add the remaining herbs and the celery leaves and continue to pulse. Stop from time to time to scrape the sides with a rubber spatula and mix the herbs to redistribute them. Run the machine for up to 10 minutes, until the mixture is almost liquefied.\nTransfer the mixture to a large saucepan and stir in the spice mix.\nAdd the remaining 5 cups (1.2 kilograms) cold water to the onions and bring to a gentle boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and boil gently for about 1 hour or until the liquid is reduced by half.\nStir the onion mixture into the stockpot, return to a simmer, and cook for 1 1\/2 to 2 hours, skimming any impurities that rise to the top, until the soup has reduced by about one-third to just over 4 quarts (4 kilograms).\nCut a lengthwise slit down one side of each date, open it as you would a book, and remove the pit. Cut the dates lengthwise in half, then cut each half lengthwise into 4 strips. Using your fingertips, shape each strip into a rough ball. If you keep the skin side facing out, the ball will be less sticky and will hold together better.\nPour a shallow pool of olive oil into a small bowl. Rub a little of the oil on the center of one palm, put a date ball on it, and use the index finger of your other hand to roll the date into a smooth ball. Put the ball in the bowl of oil, and repeat with the rest of the dates, adding more oil to the bowl as needed to keep the date balls covered. Set aside.\nPut the lentils in a saucepan, add 6 cups (1.4 kilograms) cold water, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook the lentils for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring them from time to time.\nMeanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water. Taste a lentil. When they have started to soften but are still firm in the center, drain them in a fine-mesh strainer, rinse them with cold water, and submerge them in the bowl of cold water until ready to use.\nRemove the tough outer celery stalks and reserve them for another use. Pinch off the leaves from the inner stalks and place the leaves in a bowl of ice water. Cut the stalks into 1\/8-inch dice; you need 1 cup (120 grams). Put the diced celery in a small bowl, toss with the olive oil and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.\nOnce the soup has reduced, add the lentils; keep warm over low heat.\nWhisk together the flour, water, and yeast in a small bowl and let sit at room temperature until foamy and bubbling, about 10 minutes.\nWhisking constantly, add the flour mixture to the soup, then stir with a flat-bottomed wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pot, as you bring the soup to a simmer over medium heat. (High heat could cause the flour to stick to the bottom of the pot.) Simmer the soup gently, stirring often, for 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt, remove the soup from the heat, and stir in the lemon juice.\nDrain and dry the celery leaves. Using 2 soupspoons, form the celery salad into a quenelle or football shape and place toward the rim of each soup bowl. Stack about 8 date balls alongside each quenelle. (If you end up with extra date balls, keep them in the refrigerator and add them to salads.)\nCarefully ladle the soup around the garnishes so that a bit of the celery salad and the date balls remain visible. Drizzle some of the olive oil that remains in the bowl of celery salad over the soup and garnish with the celery leaves.",

Put the pieces in a large baking dish or roasting pan with the pears and all but a few slices of the ginger. Brush with oil, season with salt, and bake until fragrant and tender, about 1 hour. Turn the pieces once or twice so that they have a chance to caramelize on more than one surface. If the squash seems very dry (some varieties are), add 1 cup water to the pan to create steam and cover with foil. When the squash is tender, transfer everything from the pan to a cutting board, add 1 cup water to the pan, and scrape to dissolve the juices, reserving the liquid. Scrape the flesh of the squash away from the skins. You should have about 2 cups.\n2.

    "Ingredients":"['2 1\/2 tablespoons butter', '1 small onion, chopped', '1 celery rib, chopped', '1 1\/2 teaspoons dried basil, crumbled between your fingers', 'Pinch of ground cloves', '2 tablespoons flour', 'Two 15-ounce cans diced tomatoes in puree or juice', 'Pinch of baking soda', '2 1\/2 cups vegetable stock or water', '1 1\/2 cups milk', 'Sea salt and freshly ground pepper', 'Tomato paste if needed', '1 egg, separated, or 1 egg white only', '1 teaspoon Dijon mustard', 'Pinch of cayenne', '1 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese', '1 teaspoon minced scallion or shallot', '4 slices sandwich bread, lightly toasted']",
    "Instructions":"1. Melt the butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, basil, and cloves; cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, then add the tomatoes, baking soda, and stock. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Let cool briefly, then puree in a blender until smooth\n2. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Return the soup to the pot, add the milk, and season with salt. If the soup is too thick, thin it with additional milk or stock. If the tomato flavor isn't as rich as you'd like (if the tomatoes were packed in water instead of puree), deepen it by stirring in a little tomato paste.\n3. For the toasts, combine the yolk, if you're using it, with the mustard and cayenne, then stir in the cheese. Whisk the white until it holds soft peaks and fold it into the mixture along with the scallion. Spread the mixture on the toasted bread and bake until puffed and golden, about 5 minutes, while you reheat the soup. Serve the soup piping hot, with a piece of cheese toast, cut in half on the diagonal, and fresh pepper ground into each bowl.",

With the machine on, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil through the feed tube.\nScrape the mixture into a large bowl. You need 1 cup of puree, so nosh on any extra. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Add the matzo meal and stir well. If you can form a lump into a very soft walnut-size ball (the batter will become firmer when you chill it), don't add any more matzo meal. If necessary, add just enough matzo meal to enable you to do so. Refrigerate for at least 2 or up to 4 hours so the matzo meal can drink in the liquid and seasoning.\nWhen ready to cook, bring 4 quarts water and 1 tablespoon of salt to a rapid boil in a large, wide, lidded pot. Dipping your hands into cold water if needed, roll the batter into walnut-size balls. When all the balls are rolled and the water is boiling furiously, turn the heat down to a gentle boil. Carefully slide in the balls one at a time and cover the pot tightly.\nTurn the heat down to a simmer, and cook over low heat for 30 minutes, without removing the cover. (They will cook by direct heat as well as by steam, which makes them puff and swell, and lifting the lid will allow some of that steam to escape.) Take out a dumpling and cut it in half. It should be light, fluffy and completely cooked through. If it isn't, continue cooking a few more minutes. Remove the balls gently with a skimmer or large slotted spoon\u2014they are too fragile to pour into a colander.\nWhen the matzo balls are almost ready, start the soup: Bring the broth to a simmer in a large pot. Add the matzo balls, the mushrooms, and asparagus and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer the matzo balls to shallow soup bowls and ladle the hot soup and the vegetables over them. Garnish with the reserved chopped fennel fronds.",

Serve hot, topped with horseradish cream, or serve chilled.\n: If you plan on serving this soup at two seders and want some variety on the second night, try this twist that combines Eastern European knaidlach (matzoh balls) and Middle Eastern kibbeh (meatballs): Prepare matzoh ball dough (you can use a packaged mix) and chill at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together ground beef or lamb, chopped onion, chopped celery, chopped fresh mint, a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Form the meat into mini-meatballs. Wrap matzoh ball dough around each meatball to form \"knaidlach kibbeh.\" Boil the balls according to the package directions (the meat will cook inside them). Place two balls in each bowl of hot soup.",

    "Recipe_Name":"Vietnamese \"Pho\" Rice Noodle Soup with Beef",
    "Ingredients":"['5 pounds beef marrow or knuckle bones', '2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2 pieces', '2 (3-inch) pieces ginger, cut in half lengthwise and lightly bruised with the flat side of a knife, lightly charred (see Note, below)', '2 yellow onions, peeled and charred (see Note, below)', '1\/4 cup fish sauce', '3 ounces rock sugar, or 3 tablespoons sugar', '10 whole star anise, lightly toasted in a dry pan', '6 whole cloves, lightly toasted in a dry pan', '1 tablespoon sea salt', '1 pound dried 1\/16-inch-wide rice sticks, soaked, cooked and drained (see Tips, below)', '1\/3 pound beef sirloin, slightly frozen, then sliced paper-thin across the grain', '1\/2 yellow onion, sliced paper-thin', '3 scallions, cut into thin rings', '1\/3 cup chopped cilantro', '1 pound bean sprouts', '10 sprigs Asian basil', '1 dozen saw-leaf herb leaves (optional)', '6 Thai bird chilies or 1 serrano chili, cut into thin rings', '1 lime, cut into 6 thin wedges', 'Freshly ground black pepper']",
    "Instructions":"1. In a large stockpot, bring 6 quarts water to a boil. Place the bones and beef chuck in a second pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil and boil vigorously for 5 minutes. Using tongs, carefully transfer the bones and beef to the first pot of boiling water. Discard the water in which the meat cooked. (This cleans the bones and meat and reduces the impurities that can cloud the broth.) When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim the surface often to remove any foam and fat. Add the charred ginger and onions, fish sauce and sugar. Simmer until the beef chuck is tender, about 40 minutes. Remove one piece and submerge in cool water for 10 minutes to prevent the meat from darkening and drying out. Drain, then cut into thin slices and set aside. Let the other piece of beef chuck continue to cook in the simmering broth.\n2. When the broth has been simmering for about 1 1\/2 hours total, wrap the star anise and cloves in a spice bag (or piece of cheesecloth) and add to the broth. Let infuse until the broth is fragrant, about 30 minutes. Remove and discard both the spice bag and onions. Add the salt and continue to simmer, skimming as necessary, until you're ready to assemble the dish. The broth needs to cook for at least 2 hours. (The broth will taste salty but will be balanced once the noodles and accompaniments are added.) Leave the remaining chuck and bones to simmer in the pot while you assemble the bowls.\n3. To serve, place the cooked noodles in preheated bowls. (If the noodles are not hot, reheat them in a microwave or dip them briefly in boiling water to prevent them from cooling down the soup.) Place a few slices of the beef chuck and the raw sirloin on the noodles. Bring the broth to a rolling boil; ladle about 2 to 3 cups into each bowl. The broth will cook the raw beef instantly. Garnish with yellow onions, scallions and cilantro. Serve immediately, inviting guests to garnish the bowls with bean sprouts, herbs, chilies, lime juice and black pepper.\nTo char ginger, hold the piece with tongs directly over an open flame or place it directly on a medium-hot electric burner. While turning, char until the edges are slightly blackened and the ginger is fragrant, about 3 to 4 minutes. Char the onions in the same way. Peel and discard the blackened skins of the ginger and onions, then rinse and add to the broth.",

    "Recipe_Name":"Easter Lamb Soup",
    "Ingredients":"['Head, neck, some intestines, and liver of a young lamb or 3 pounds lamb bones', '2 large onions, halved', 'Sea salt', '1\/2 cup olive oil', '2 cups finely chopped scallions', '1 small chili pepper, minced, or freshly ground pepper to taste', '1 1\/2 cups chopped fresh dill', '2 eggs', 'Juice of 1 1\/2-2 lemons']",
    "Instructions":"Wash the lamb head and neck thoroughly and place in a pot with the onions. Cover with cold water, season with salt, and simmer for about 1 hour, skimming the surface several times.\nCut the intestines into several pieces and wash thoroughly under running water. If you like, slice them open so you can wash them more easily. In a separate pan, bring some salted water to a boil and add the intestines. Blanch for 2 minutes, then remove with a skimmer and discard the water. Chop the intestines finely. You don't need more than 1 cup of chopped intestines.\nThe head and neck are done when the meat falls from the bones. Remove them from the pot. Using a sharp knife, cut open the head and separate the meat from the bones. Remove the meat from the neck and cut all the meat into small pieces. Strain the stock and discard the onions. Let the stock cool and remove the fat. (Up to this point, the preparations can be made a day ahead. You can refrigerate the meat and the stock, making it easier to skim off the fat.)\nTo finish the soup, wash the liver well and cut it into small cubes. In a skillet, heat the olive oil and saut\u00e9 the liver with the scallions and chili pepper, if using. Add the finely chopped meat and intestines, together with 1 cup of the dill, and turn a few times with a wooden spoon. Transfer the mixture to a pot and add the stock plus an equal amount of water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes. Taste and add more pepper and salt if needed.\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl with about 2 spoonfuls of water and the juice of 1 lemon. Slowly add cupfuls of the hot soup to the bowl, beating continuously with the whisk. When the egg mixture is very hot, pour it slowly into the pot, stirring well, over very low heat, to prevent curdling. Taste and add more lemon juice if needed. Sprinkle with the rest of the dill, and serve immediately.\nNOTE: Some people add 1\/2 to 1 cup short-grain rice to the soup.\nIf you hate the taste of boiled lamb, you can make an equally tasty magiritsa with chicken livers and chicken stock. There is even a meatless magiritsa. Saut\u00e9 the scallions and dill, adding a few chopped leaves of romaine lettuce. Pour in water or stock and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Make the egg and lemon mixture as described above and serve.",

    "Instructions":"In the medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons\/28 g of the butter over medium heat and add the onion. Cook until the onion is soft and translucent, then add the mushrooms and the remaining butter. Let the mixture sweat for about 8 minutes, taking care that the onion doesn't take on any brown color. Stir in the chicken stock and the parsley and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat and simmer for about an hour.\nAfter an hour, remove the parsley and discard. Let the soup cool for a few minutes, then transfer to the blender and carefully blend at high speed until smooth. Do I have to remind you to do this in stages, with the blender's lid firmly held down, and with the weight of your body keeping that thing from flying off and allowing boiling hot mushroom pur\u00e9e to erupt all over your kitchen?\nWhen blended, return the mix to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and bring up to a simmer again. Add the sherry, mix well, and serve immediately.\nTo astound your guests with a Wild Mushroom Soup, simply replace some of those button mushrooms with a few dried c\u00e8pes or morels, which have been soaked until soft, drained, and squeezed. Not too many; the dried mushrooms will have a much stronger taste, and you don't want to overwhelm the soup. Pan sear, on high heat, a single small, pretty, fresh chanterelle or morel for each portion, and then slice into a cute fan and float on top in each bowl.\nAnd if you really want to ratchet your soup into pretentious (but delicious), drizzle a few tiny drops of truffle oil over the surface just before serving. Why the hell not? Everybody else is doing it.",
